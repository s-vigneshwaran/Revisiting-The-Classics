491,In vowing new hate after new love bearing:,0,English
491,"But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,",0,English
491,When I break twenty? I am perjured most;,0,English
491,"For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee,",0,English
491,And all my honest faith in thee is lost:,0,English
491,"For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,",0,English
491,"Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy;",0,English
491,"And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,",0,English
491,Or made them swear against the thing they see;,0,English

491,   To swear against the truth so foul a lie!,0,English
492,Cupid laid by his brand and fell asleep:,0,English
492,"A maid of Dian's this advantage found,",0,English
492,And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep,0,English
492,In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;,0,English
492,"Which borrowed from this holy fire of Love,",0,English
492,"A dateless lively heat, still to endure,",0,English
492,"And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove",0,English
492,Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.,0,English
492,"But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,",1,English
492,The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;,1,English
492,"I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,",0,English
492,"And thither hied, a sad distempered guest,",0,English
492,"   But found no cure, the bath for my help lies",0,English
492,   Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.,1,English
493,"The little Love-god lying once asleep,",0,English
493,"Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,",0,English
493,Whilst many nymphs that vowed chaste life to keep,0,English
493,Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand,0,English
493,The fairest votary took up that fire,0,English
493,Which many legions of true hearts had warmed;,0,English
493,And so the General of hot desire,0,English
493,"Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarmed.",0,English
493,"This brand she quenched in a cool well by,",0,English
493,"Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,",0,English
493,"Growing a bath and healthful remedy,",0,English
493,"For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,",1,English

493,"   Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.",0,English
494,"In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,",0,English

494,"Who, in despite of view, is pleased to dote;",0,English
494,"Nor are mine ears with thy tongue’s tune delighted,",0,English
494,"Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,",0,English
494,"Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited",0,English
494,To any sensual feast with thee alone:,0,English
494,But my five wits nor my five senses can,0,English
494,"Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,",0,English
494,"Who leaves unswayed the likeness of a man,",0,English
494,Thy proud heart’s slave and vassal wretch to be.,1,English
494,"Only my plague thus far I count my gain,",0,English
494,That she that makes me sin awards me pain.,1,English

495,But no such roses see I in her cheeks;,0,English
495,And in some perfumes is there more delight,0,English
495,Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.,1,English
495,"I love to hear her speak, yet well I know",0,English
495,That music hath a far more pleasing sound:,0,English
495,"I grant I never saw a goddess go,",0,English
495,"My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:",1,English
495,"And yet by heaven, I think my love as rare,",0,English
495, As any she belied with false compare.,0,English
496,"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,",0,English
496,And sorry I could not travel both,0,English
496,"And be one traveler, long I stood",0,English
496,And looked down one as far as I could,0,English
496,To where it bent in the undergrowth;,0,English
496,"Then took the other, as just as fair,",0,English
496,"And having perhaps the better claim,",0,English
496,Because it was grassy and wanted wear;,0,English
496,Though as for that the passing there,0,English
496,"Had worn them really about the same,",0,English
496,And both that morning equally lay,0,English
496,In leaves no step had trodden black.,0,English
496,"Oh, I kept the first for another day!",0,English
496,"Yet knowing how way leads on to way,",0,English
496,I doubted if I should ever come back.,0,English
496,I shall be telling this with a sigh,0,English
496,Somewhere ages and ages hence:,0,English
496,"Two roads diverged in a wood, and I -",0,English
496,"I took the one less traveled by,",0,English
496,And that has made all the difference.,0,English
497,Whose woods these are I think I know.,0,English
497,His house is in the village though;,0,English
497,He will not see me stopping here,0,English
497,To watch his woods fill up with snow.,0,English
497,My little horse must think it queer,0,English
497,To stop without a farmhouse near,0,English
497,Between the woods and frozen lake,0,English
497,The darkest evening of the year.,0,English
497,He gives his harness bells a shake,0,English
497,To ask if there is some mistake.,0,English
497,The only other sound's the sweep,0,English
497,Of easy wind and downy flake.,0,English
497,"The woods are lovely, dark and deep,",0,English
497,"But I have promises to keep,",0,English
497,"And miles to go before I sleep,",0,English
497,And miles to go before I sleep.,0,English
498,When I see birches bend to left and right,0,English
498,"Across the lines of straighter darker trees,",0,English
498,I like to think some boy's been swinging them.,1,English
498,But swinging doesn't bend them down to stay.,0,English
498,Ice-storms do that. Often you must have seen them,0,English
498,Loaded with ice a sunny winter morning,0,English
498,After a rain. They click upon themselves,0,English
498,"As the breeze rises, and turn many-colored",0,English
498,As the stir cracks and crazes their enamel.,0,English
498,Soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells,0,English
498,Shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust -,0,English
498,Such heaps of broken glass to sweep away,0,English
498,You'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen.,0,English
498,"They are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,",0,English
498,And they seem not to break; though once they are bowed,0,English
498,"So low for long, they never right themselves:",0,English
498,You may see their trunks arching in the woods,0,English
498,"Years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground",0,English
498,Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair,1,English
498,Before them over their heads to dry in the sun.,0,English
498,But I was going to say when Truth broke in,0,English
498,With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm,0,English
498,(Now am I free to be poetical?),0,English
498,I should prefer to have some boy bend them,1,English
498,As he went out and in to fetch the cows -,0,English
498,"Some boy too far from town to learn baseball,",0,English
498,"Whose only play was what he found himself,",0,English
498,"Summer or winter, and could play alone.",0,English
498,One by one he subdued his father's trees,0,English
498,By riding them down over and over again,0,English
498,"Until he took the stiffness out of them,",0,English
498,"And not one but hung limp, not one was left",0,English
498,For him to conquer. He learned all there was,0,English
498,To learn about not launching out too soon,0,English
498,And so not carrying the tree away,0,English
498,Clear to the ground. He always kept his poise,0,English
498,"To the top branches, climbing carefully",0,English
498,With the same pains you use to fill a cup,0,English
498,"Up to the brim, and even above the brim.",0,English
498,"Then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,",0,English
498,Kicking his way down through the air to the ground.,0,English
498,So was I once myself a swinger of birches.,0,English
498,And so I dream of going back to be.,0,English
498,"It's when I'm weary of considerations,",0,English
498,And life is too much like a pathless wood,0,English
498,Where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs,0,English
498,"Broken across it, and one eye is weeping",0,English
498,From a twig's having lashed across it open.,0,English
498,I'd like to get away from earth awhile,0,English
498,And then come back to it and begin over.,0,English
498,May no fate willfully misunderstand me,0,English
498,And half grant what I wish and snatch me away,0,English
498,Not to return. Earth's the right place for love:,0,English
498,I don't know where it's likely to go better.,0,English
498,"I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,",0,English
498,And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk,0,English
498,"Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,",0,English
498,But dipped its top and set me down again.,0,English
498,That would be good both going and coming back.,0,English
498,One could do worse than be a swinger of birches.,0,English
499,"Something there is that doesn't love a wall,",0,English
499,"That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,",0,English
499,And spills the upper boulders in the sun;,0,English
499,And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.,0,English
499,The work of hunters is another thing:,0,English
499,I have come after them and made repair,0,English
499,"Where they have left not one stone on a stone,",0,English
499,"But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,",0,English
499,"To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,",0,English
499,"No one has seen them made or heard them made,",0,English
499,But at spring mending-time we find them there.,0,English
499,I let my neighbour know beyond the hill;,0,English
499,And on a day we meet to walk the line,0,English
499,And set the wall between us once again.,0,English
499,We keep the wall between us as we go.,0,English
499,To each the boulders that have fallen to each.,0,English
499,And some are loaves and some so nearly balls,0,English
499,We have to use a spell to make them balance:,0,English
499,"""Stay where you are until our backs are turned!""",0,English
499,We wear our fingers rough with handling them.,0,English
499,"Oh, just another kind of out-door game,",0,English
499,One on a side. It comes to little more:,0,English
499,There where it is we do not need the wall:,0,English
499,He is all pine and I am apple orchard.,0,English
499,My apple trees will never get across,0,English
499,"And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.",0,English
499,"He only says, ""Good fences make good neighbours.""",0,English
499,"Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder",0,English
499,If I could put a notion in his head:,0,English
499,"""Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it",0,English
499,Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.,0,English
499,Before I built a wall I'd ask to know,0,English
499,"What I was walling in or walling out,",0,English
499,And to whom I was like to give offence.,0,English
499,"Something there is that doesn't love a wall,",0,English
499,"That wants it down."" I could say ""Elves"" to him,",0,English
499,"But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather",0,English
499,He said it for himself. I see him there,0,English
499,Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top,0,English
499,"In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.",0,English
499,"He moves in darkness as it seems to me,",0,English
499,Not of woods only and the shade of trees.,0,English
499,"He will not go behind his father's saying,",0,English
499,And he likes having thought of it so well,0,English
499,"He says again, ""Good fences make good neighbours.""",0,English
500,"Nature's first green is gold,",0,English
500,Her hardest hue to hold.,0,English
500,Her early leaf's a flower;,0,English
500,But only so an hour.,0,English
500,"Then leaf subsides to leaf,",0,English
500,"So Eden sank to grief,",0,English
500,So dawn goes down to day,0,English
500,Nothing gold can stay.,0,English
500,All out of doors looked darkly in at him,0,English
500,"Through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,",0,English
500,That gathers on the pane in empty rooms.,0,English
500,What kept his eyes from giving back the gaze,0,English
500,Was the lamp tilted near them in his hand.,0,English
500,What kept him from remembering what it was,0,English
500,That brought him to that creaking room was age.,0,English
500,He stood with barrels round him - at a loss.,0,English
500,And having scared the cellar under him,0,English
500,"In clomping there, he scared it once again",0,English
500,"In clomping off; - and scared the outer night,",0,English
500,"Which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar",0,English
500,"Of trees and crack of branches, common things,",0,English
500,But nothing so like beating on a box.,0,English
500,A light he was to no one but himself,0,English
500,"Where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,",0,English
500,"A quiet light, and then not even that.",0,English
500,"He consigned to the moon, such as she was,",0,English
500,"So late-arising, to the broken moon",0,English
500,As better than the sun in any case,0,English
500,"For such a charge, his snow upon the roof,",0,English
500,His icicles along the wall to keep;,0,English
500,And slept. The log that shifted with a jolt,0,English
500,"Once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,",0,English
500,"And eased his heavy breathing, but still slept.",0,English
500,"One aged man - one man - can't fill a house,",0,English
500,"A farm, a countryside, or if he can,",0,English
500,It's thus he does it of a winter night.,0,English
501,Out walking in the frozen swamp one grey day,0,English
501,"I paused and said, ""I will turn back from here.",0,English
501,"No, I will go on farther--and we shall see.""",0,English
501,"The hard snow held me, save where now and then",0,English
501,One foot went down. The view was all in lines,0,English
501,Straight up and down of tall slim trees,0,English
501,Too much alike to mark or name a place by,0,English
501,So as to say for certain I was here,0,English
501,Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.,0,English
501,A small bird flew before me. He was careful,0,English
501,"To put a tree between us when he lighted,",0,English
501,And say no word to tell me who he was,0,English
501,Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.,0,English
501,He thought that I was after him for a feather--,0,English
501,The white one in his tail; like one who takes,0,English
501,Everything said as personal to himself.,0,English
501,One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.,0,English
501,And then there was a pile of wood for which,0,English
501,I forgot him and let his little fear,0,English
501,"Carry him off the way I might have gone,",0,English
501,Without so much as wishing him good-night.,0,English
501,He went behind it to make his last stand.,0,English
501,"It was a cord of maple, cut and split",0,English
501,"And piled--and measured, four by four by eight.",0,English
501,And not another like it could I see.,0,English
501,No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.,0,English
501,"And it was older sure than this year's cutting,",0,English
501,Or even last year's or the year's before.,0,English
501,The wood was grey and the bark warping off it,0,English
501,And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis,0,English
501,Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.,0,English
501,What held it though on one side was a tree,0,English
501,"Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,",0,English
501,These latter about to fall. I thought that only,0,English
501,Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks,0,English
501,Could so forget his handiwork on which,0,English
501,"He spent himself, the labour of his axe,",0,English
501,And leave it there far from a useful fireplace,0,English
501,To warm the frozen swamp as best it could,0,English
501,With the slow smokeless burning of decay.,0,English
502,"Some say the world will end in fire,",0,English
502,Some say in ice.,0,English
502,From what I've tasted of desire,0,English
502,I hold with those who favor fire.,0,English
502,"But if it had to perish twice,",0,English
502,I think I know enough of hate,0,English
502,To know that for destruction ice,0,English
502,Is also great,0,English
502,And would suffice.,0,English
503,I have been one acquainted with the night.,0,English
503,I have walked out in rain - and back in rain.,0,English
503,I have outwalked the furthest city light.,0,English
503,I have looked down the saddest city lane.,0,English
503,I have passed by the watchman on his beat,0,English
503,"And dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain.",0,English
503,I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet,0,English
503,When far away an interrupted cry,0,English
503,"Came over houses from another street,",0,English
503,But not to call me back or say good-bye;,0,English
503,"And further still at an unearthly height,",0,English
503,One luminary clock against the sky,0,English
503,Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right.,0,English
503,I have been one acquainted with the night.,0,English
504,"Thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too,",0,English
504,"And the daft sun-assaulter, he",0,English
504,"That frighted thee so oft, is fled or dead:",0,English
504,Save only me,0,English
504,(Nor is it sad to thee!),0,English
504,Save only me,0,English
504,There is none left to mourn thee in the fields.,0,English
504,The gray grass is not dappled with the snow;,0,English
504,Its two banks have not shut upon the river;,0,English
504,But it is long ago--,0,English
504,It seems forever--,0,English
504,"Since first I saw thee glance,",0,English
504,"With all the dazzling other ones,",0,English
504,"In airy dalliance,",0,English
504,"Precipitate in love,",0,English
504,"Tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above,",0,English
504,Like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance.,0,English
504,"When that was, the soft mist",0,English
504,"Of my regret hung not on all the land,",0,English
504,"And I was glad for thee,",0,English
504,"And glad for me, I wist.",0,English
504,"Thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high,",0,English
504,"That fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind,",0,English
504,"With those great careless wings,",0,English
504,Nor yet did I.,0,English
504,And there were other things:,0,English
504,It seemed God let thee flutter from his gentle clasp:,0,English
504,Then fearful he had let thee win,0,English
504,"Too far beyond him to be gathered in,",0,English
504,"Snatched thee, o'er eager, with ungentle grasp.",0,English
504,Ah! I remember me,0,English
504,How once conspiracy was rife,0,English
504,Against my life--,0,English
504,The languor of it and the dreaming fond;,0,English
504,"Surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought,",0,English
504,"The breeze three odors brought,",0,English
504,And a gem-flower waved in a wand!,0,English
504,Then when I was distraught,0,English
504,"And could not speak,",0,English
504,"Sidelong, full on my cheek,",0,English
504,What should that reckless zephyr fling,0,English
504,But the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing!,0,English
504,I found that wing broken to-day!,0,English
504,"For thou are dead, I said,",0,English
504,And the strange birds say.,0,English
504,I found it with the withered leaves,0,English
504,Under the eaves.,0,English
505,Always--I tell you this they learned--,0,English
505,Always at night when they returned,0,English
505,To the lonely house from far away,0,English
505,"To lamps unlighted and fire gone gray,",0,English
505,They learned to rattle the lock and key,0,English
505,To give whatever might chance to be,0,English
505,Warning and time to be off in flight:,0,English
505,"And preferring the out- to the in-door night,",0,English
505,They learned to leave the house-door wide,0,English
505,Until they had lit the lamp inside.,0,English
506,By June our brook's run out of song and speed.,0,English
506,"Sought for much after that, it will be found",0,English
506,Either to have gone groping underground,0,English
506,(And taken with it all the Hyla breed,0,English
506,"That shouted in the mist a month ago,",0,English
506,Like ghost of sleigh-bells in a ghost of snow) -,0,English
506,"Or flourished and come up in jewel-weed,",0,English
506,Weak foliage that is blown upon and bent,0,English
506,Even against the way its waters went.,0,English
506,Its bed is left a faded paper sheet,0,English
506,Of dead leaves stuck together by the heat -,0,English
506,A brook to none but who remember long.,0,English
506,This as it will be seen is other far,0,English
506,Than with brooks taken otherwhere in song.,0,English
506,We love the things we love for what they are.,0,English
507,"It was too lonely for her there,",0,English
507,"And too wild,",0,English
507,"And since there were but two of them,",0,English
507,"And no child,",0,English
507,"And work was little in the house,",0,English
507,"She was free,",0,English
507,"And followed where he furrowed field,",0,English
507,Or felled tree.,0,English
507,She rested on a log and tossed,0,English
507,"The fresh chips,",0,English
507,With a song only to herself,0,English
507,On her lips.,0,English
507,And once she went to break a bough,0,English
507,Of black alder.,0,English
507,She strayed so far she scarcely heard,0,English
507,When he called her--,0,English
507,And didn't answer--didn't speak--,0,English
507,Or return.,0,English
507,"She stood, and then she ran and hid",0,English
507,In the fern.,0,English
507,"He never found her, though he looked",0,English

508,"Smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,",0,English
508,Half closes the garden path.,0,English
508,"And when I come to the garden ground,",0,English
508,The whir of sober birds,0,English
508,Up from the tangle of withered weeds,0,English
508,Is sadder than any words.,0,English
508,"A tree beside the wall stands bare,",0,English
508,"But a leaf that lingered brown,",0,English
508,"Disturbed, I doubt not, by my thought,",0,English
508,Comes softly rattling down.,0,English
508,I end not far from my going forth,0,English
508,By picking the faded blue,0,English
508,Of the last remaining aster flower,0,English
508,To carry again to you.,0,English
509,"Once on the kind of day called ""weather breeder,""",0,English
509,When the heat slowly hazes and the sun,0,English
509,"By its own power seems to be undone,",0,English
509,"I was half boring through, half climbing through",0,English
509,A swamp of cedar. Choked with oil of cedar,0,English
509,"And scurf of plants, and weary and over-heated,",0,English
509,"And sorry I ever left the road I knew,",0,English
509,I paused and rested on a sort of hook,0,English
509,"That had me by the coat as good as seated,",0,English
509,"And since there was no other way to look,",0,English
509,"Looked up toward heaven, and there against the blue,",0,English
509,"Stood over me a resurrected tree,",0,English
509,A tree that had been down and raised again -,0,English
509,"A barkless spectre. He had halted too,",0,English
509,As if for fear of treading upon me.,0,English
509,I saw the strange position of his hands -,0,English

509,Of wire with something in it from men to men.,0,English
509,"""You here?"" I said. ""Where aren't you nowadays",0,English

509,And tell me where you're off for - Montreal?,0,English

509,Sometimes I wander out of beaten ways,0,English
509,"Half looking for the orchid Calypso.""",0,English
510,"It went many years,",0,English
510,"But at last came a knock,",0,English
510,And I thought of the door,0,English
510,With no lock to lock.,0,English
510,"I blew out the light,",0,English
510,"I tip-toed the floor,",0,English
510,And raised both hands,0,English
510,In prayer to the door.,0,English
510,But the knock came again,0,English
510,My window was wide;,0,English
510,I climbed on the sill,0,English
510,And descended outside.,0,English
510,Back over the sill,0,English
510,"I bade a ""Come in""",0,English

510,At the door may have been.,0,English
510,So at a knock,0,English

510,To hide in the world,0,English
510,And alter with age.,0,English
511,"My Sorrow, when she's here with me,",0,English

511,"The faded earth, the heavy sky,",0,English
511,"The beauties she so truly sees,",0,English

511,"But it were vain to tell her so,",0,English
511,And they are better for her praise.,0,English
512,"There is a singer everyone has heard,",0,English
512,"Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,",0,English

512,He says that leaves are old and that for flowers,0,English
512,Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.,0,English
512,He says the early petal-fall is past,0,English
512,When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers,0,English
512,On sunny days a moment overcast;,0,English
512,And comes that other fall we name the fall.,0,English

513,The sturdy seedling with arched body comes,0,English
513,Shouldering its way and shedding the earth crumbs.,0,English
514,I wonder about the trees.,0,English

514,Forever the noise of these,0,English
514,More than another noise,0,English
514,So close to our dwelling place?,0,English

514,"And that talks no less for knowing,",0,English
514,"As it grows wiser and older,",0,English

516,Such as we were we gave ourselves outright,0,English

517,The playthings in the playhouse of the children.,0,English
517,Weep for what little things could make them glad.,0,English
517,"Then for the house that is no more a house,",0,English
517,"But only a belilaced cellar hole,",0,English
517,Now slowly closing like a dent in dough.,0,English

517,Too lofty and original to rage.,0,English
517,(We know the valley streams that when aroused,0,English
517,Will leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn.),0,English
517,I have kept hidden in the instep arch,0,English
517,Of an old cedar at the waterside,0,English
517,A broken drinking goblet like the Grail,0,English
517,"Under a spell so the wrong ones can't find it,",0,English
517,"So can't get saved, as Saint Mark says they mustn't.",0,English

518,My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree,0,English
518,"Toward heaven still,",0,English
518,And there's a barrel that I didn't fill,0,English
518,"Beside it, and there may be two or three",0,English

518,But I am done with apple-picking now.,0,English
518,"Essence of winter sleep is on the night,",0,English
518,The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.,0,English
518,I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight,0,English
518,I got from looking through a pane of glass,0,English
518,I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough,0,English
518,And held against the world of hoary grass.,0,English
518,"It melted, and I let it fall and break.",0,English
518,But I was well,0,English
518,"Upon my way to sleep before it fell,",0,English

518,What form my dreaming was about to take.,0,English
518,"Magnified apples appear and disappear,",0,English
518,"Stem end and blossom end,",0,English
518,And every fleck of russet showing clear.,0,English
518,"My instep arch not only keeps the ache,",0,English
518,It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.,0,English
518,I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.,0,English
518,And I keep hearing from the cellar bin,0,English
518,The rumbling sound,0,English
518,Of load on load of apples coming in.,0,English
518,For I have had too much,0,English
518,Of apple-picking: I am overtired,0,English
518,Of the great harvest I myself desired.,0,English
518,"There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,",0,English
518,"Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.",0,English
518,For all,0,English
518,"That struck the earth,",0,English
518,"No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,",0,English
518,Went surely to the cider-apple heap,0,English
518,As of no worth.,0,English
518,One can see what will trouble,0,English
518,"This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.",0,English
518,"Were he not gone,",0,English
518,The woodchuck could say whether it's like his,0,English
518,"Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,",0,English
518,Or just some human sleep.,0,English
519,Mary sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table,0,English
519,"Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,",0,English
519,She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage,0,English
519,To meet him in the doorway with the news,0,English
519,And put him on his guard. 'Silas is back.',0,English
519,She pushed him outward with her through the door,0,English
519,"And shut it after her. 'Be kind,' she said.",0,English
519,She took the market things from Warren's arms,0,English
519,"And set them on the porch, then drew him down",0,English
519,To sit beside her on the wooden steps.,0,English
519,'When was I ever anything but kind to him?',0,English

519,What help he is there's no depending on.,0,English
519,Off he goes always when I need him most.,0,English
519,"He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,",0,English
519,"Enough at least to buy tobacco with,",0,English
519,So he won't have to beg and be beholden.,0,English

519,"Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.""",0,English
519,"""Someone else can."" ""Then someone else will have to.""",0,English
519,I shouldn't mind his bettering himself,0,English

519,"Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,-",0,English
519,"In haying time, when any help is scarce.",0,English
519,In winter he comes back to us. I'm done.',0,English
519,"'Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you,' Mary said.",0,English
519,'I want him to: he'll have to soon or late.',0,English
519,'He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove.,0,English
519,"When I came up from Rowe's I found him here,",0,English
519,"Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,",0,English
519,"A miserable sight, and frightening, too -",0,English
519,You needn't smile - I didn't recognize him -,0,English
519,I wasn't looking for him - and he's changed.,0,English
519,Wait till you see.',0,English
519,'Where did you say he'd been?',0,English
519,"'He didn't say. I dragged him to the house,",0,English
519,And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.,0,English
519,I tried to make him talk about his travels.,0,English
519,Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off.',0,English
519,'What did he say? Did he say anything?',0,English
519,'But little.',0,English
519,"'Anything? Mary, confess",0,English
519,He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me.',0,English
519,'Warren!',0,English
519,'But did he? I just want to know.',0,English
519,'Of course he did. What would you have him say?,0,English
519,Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man,0,English
519,Some humble way to save his self-respect.,0,English
519,"He added, if you really care to know,",0,English
519,"He meant to clear the upper pasture, too.",0,English
519,That sounds like something you have heard before?,0,English
519,"Warren, I wish you could have heard the way",0,English
519,He jumbled everything. I stopped to look,0,English
519,Two or three times - he made me feel so queer -,0,English
519,To see if he was talking in his sleep.,0,English
519,He ran on Harold Wilson - you remember -,0,English
519,The boy you had in haying four years since.,0,English
519,"He's finished school, and teaching in his college.",0,English
519,Silas declares you'll have to get him back.,0,English
519,He says they two will make a team for work:,0,English

519,Harold along beside to pitch it on.',0,English
519,"'Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot.'",0,English
519,"'Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.",0,English
519,You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger!,0,English
519,Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him.,0,English
519,After so many years he still keeps finding,0,English
519,Good arguments he sees he might have used.,0,English
519,I sympathize. I know just how it feels,0,English
519,To think of the right thing to say too late.,0,English
519,Harold's associated in his mind with Latin.,0,English
519,He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying,0,English
519,He studied Latin like the violin,0,English
519,Because he liked it - that an argument!,0,English
519,He said he couldn't make the boy believe,0,English
519,He could find water with a hazel prong -,0,English
519,Which showed how much good school had ever done him.,0,English
519,He wanted to go over that. But most of all,0,English
519,He thinks if he could have another chance,0,English
519,To teach him how to build a load of hay -',0,English
519,"'I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment.",0,English
519,"He bundles every forkful in its place,",0,English
519,"And tags and numbers it for future reference,",0,English
519,So he can find and easily dislodge it,0,English
519,In the unloading. Silas does that well.,0,English
519,He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests.,0,English
519,You never see him standing on the hay,0,English
519,"He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself.'",0,English
519,"'He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be",0,English
519,Some good perhaps to someone in the world.,0,English
519,He hates to see a boy the fool of books.,0,English
519,"Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,",0,English
519,"And nothing to look backward to with pride,",0,English
519,"And nothing to look forward to with hope,",0,English
519,So now and never any different.',0,English
519,"Part of a moon was falling down the west,",0,English
519,Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.,0,English
519,Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw it,0,English
519,And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand,0,English
519,"Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,",0,English
519,"Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,",0,English
519,As if she played unheard some tenderness,0,English

519,"'Home,' he mocked gently.",0,English
519,"'Yes, what else but home?",0,English
519,It all depends on what you mean by home.,0,English
519,"Of course he's nothing to us, any more",0,English

520,Looking back over her shoulder at some fear.,0,English

533,had we but in us to assume in march,0,English
533,Such white luxuriance of May for ours.,0,English
533,"We stood a moment so in a strange world,",0,English
533,Myself as one his own pretense deceives;,0,English
533,And then I said the truth (and we moved on).,0,English
533,A young beech clinging to its last year's leaves.,0,English
534,The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift.,0,English
534,"The road is forlorn all day,",0,English
534,"Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,",0,English
534,And the hoof-prints vanish away.,0,English
534,"The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,",0,English
534,Expend their bloom in vain.,0,English
534,"Come over the hills and far with me,",0,English
534,And be my love in the rain.,0,English
534,The birds have less to say for themselves,0,English
534,In the wood-world's torn despair,0,English
534,"Than now these numberless years the elves,",0,English
534,Although they are no less there:,0,English
534,All song of the woods is crushed like some,0,English
534,"Wild, earily shattered rose.",0,English
534,"Come, be my love in the wet woods, come,",0,English
534,Where the boughs rain when it blows.,0,English
534,There is the gale to urge behind,0,English
534,"And bruit our singing down,",0,English
534,And the shallow waters aflutter with wind,0,English
534,From which to gather your gown.,0,English
534,"What matter if we go clear to the west,",0,English
534,And come not through dry-shod?,0,English
534,For wilding brooch shall wet your breast,0,English
534,The rain-fresh goldenrod.,0,English
534,"Oh, never this whelming east wind swells",0,English
534,But it seems like the sea's return,0,English
534,To the ancient lands where it left the shells,0,English
534,Before the age of the fern;,0,English
534,And it seems like the time when after doubt,0,English
534,Our love came back amain.,0,English
534,"Oh, come forth into the storm and rout",0,English
534,And be my love in the rain.,0,English
535,Never tell me that not one star of all,0,English
535,That slip from heaven at night and softly fall,0,English
535,Has been picked up with stones to build a wall.,0,English
535,"Some laborer found one faded and stone-cold,",0,English
535,And saving that its weight suggested gold,0,English
535,"And tugged it from his first too certain hold,",0,English
535,He noticed nothing in it to remark.,0,English
535,He was not used to handling stars thrown dark,0,English
535,And lifeless from an interrupted arc.,0,English
535,He did not recognize in that smooth coal,0,English
535,The one thing palpable besides the soul,0,English
535,To penetrate the air in which we roll.,0,English
535,He did not see how like a flying thing,0,English
535,"It brooded ant eggs, and bad one large wing,",0,English
535,"One not so large for flying in a ring,",0,English
535,And a long Bird of Paradise's tail,0,English
535,(Though these when not in use to fly and trail,0,English
535,It drew back in its body like a snail):,0,English
535,Nor know that be might move it from the spot -,0,English
535,The harm was done: from having been star-shot,0,English
535,The very nature of the soil was hot,0,English
535,"And burning to yield flowers instead of grain,",0,English
535,Flowers fanned and not put out by all the rain,0,English
535,Poured on them by his prayers prayed in vain.,0,English
535,"He moved it roughly with an iron bar,",0,English
535,He loaded an old stoneboat with the star,0,English
535,"And not, as you might think, a flying car,",0,English
535,Such as even poets would admit perforce,0,English
535,More practical than Pegasus the horse,0,English
535,If it could put a star back in its course.,0,English
535,He dragged it through the plowed ground at a pace,0,English
535,But faintly reminiscent of the race,0,English
535,Of jostling rock in interstellar space.,0,English
535,"It went for building stone, and I, as though",0,English
535,"Commanded in a dream, forever go",0,English
535,To right the wrong that this should have been so.,0,English
535,"Yet ask where else it could have gone as well,",0,English
535,I do not know -I cannot stop to tell:,0,English
535,He might have left it lying where it fell.,0,English
535,"From following walls I never lift my eye,",0,English
535,Except at night to places in the sky,0,English
535,Where showers of charted meteors let fly.,0,English
535,"Some may know what they seek in school and church,",0,English
535,And why they seek it there; for what I search,0,English
535,"I must go measuring stone walls, perch on perch;",0,English
535,"Sure that though not a star of death and birth,",0,English
535,"So not to be compared, perhaps, in worth",0,English
535,To such resorts of life as Mars and Earth -,0,English
535,"Though not, I say, a star of death and sin,",0,English
535,"It yet has poles, and only needs a spin",0,English
535,To show its worldly nature and begin,0,English
535,To chafe and shuffle in my calloused palm,0,English
535,"And run off in strange tangents with my arm,",0,English
535,As fish do with the line in first alarm.,0,English
535,"Such as it is, it promises the prize",0,English
535,Of the one world complete in any size,0,English
535,"That I am like to compass, fool or wise.",0,English
536,Winds blow the open grassy places bleak;,0,English
536,"But where this old wall burns a sunny cheek,",0,English
536,They eddy over it too toppling weak,0,English
536,To blow the earth or anything self-clear;,0,English
536,Moisture and color and odor thicken here.,0,English
536,The hours of daylight gather atmosphere.,0,English
537,"The farmhouse lingers, though averse to square",0,English
537,With the new city street it has to wear,0,English
537,A number in. But what about the brook,0,English
537,That held the house as in an elbow-crook?,0,English
537,"I ask as one who knew the brook, its strength",0,English
537,"And impulse, having dipped a finger length",0,English
537,"And made it leap my knuckle, having tossed",0,English
537,A flower to try its currents where they crossed.,0,English
537,The meadow grass could be cemented down,0,English
537,From growing under pavements of a town;,0,English
537,The apple trees be sent to hearth-stone flame.,0,English
537,Is water wood to serve a brook the same?,0,English
537,How else dispose of an immortal force,0,English
537,No longer needed? Staunch it at its source,0,English
537,With cinder loads dumped down? The brook was thrown,0,English
537,Deep in a sewer dungeon under stone,0,English
537,In fetid darkness still to live and run -,0,English
537,And all for nothing it had ever done,0,English
537,Except forget to go in fear perhaps.,0,English
537,No one would know except for ancient maps,0,English
537,That such a brook ran water. But I wonder,0,English
537,"If from its being kept forever under,",0,English
537,The thoughts may not have risen that so keep,0,English
537,This new-built city from both work and sleep.,0,English
538,When a friend calls to me from the road,0,English
538,"And slows his horse to a meaning walk,",0,English

538,For a friendly visit.,0,English
539,Where had I heard this wind before,0,English
539,Change like this to a deeper roar?,0,English
539,"What would it take my standing there for,",0,English
539,"Holding open a restive door,",0,English
539,Looking down hill to a frothy shore?,0,English
539,Summer was past and the day was past.,0,English
539,Sombre clouds in the west were massed.,0,English

540,By sleight of wing,0,English
540,"To better its perch for the night,",0,English
540,Though it still could sing.,0,English
540,The last of the light of the sun,0,English

543,Of the hive's enquiry squad,0,English

552,Shatter it inward on the unswept floors.,0,English
552,How had the tender verse escaped their outrage?,0,English
552,"By being invisible for what it was,",0,English
552,Or else by some remoteness that defied them,0,English
552,To find out what to do to hurt a poem.,0,English
552,"Yet oh! the tempting flatness of a book,",0,English
552,To send it sailing out the attic window,0,English
552,"Till it caught wind and, opening out its covers,",0,English
552,Tried to improve on sailing like a tile,0,English
552,"By flying like a bird (silent in flight,",0,English

552,Both either looking for or finding something.,0,English
552,The attic wasps went missing by like bullets.,0,English
552,I was soon satisfied for the time being.,0,English

552,At having eased her heart of one more copy -,0,English
552,"Legitimately. My demand upon her,",0,English
552,"Though slight, was a demand. She felt the tug.",0,English
552,In time she would be rid of all her books.,0,English

553,And give us not to think so far away,0,English

554,Thrown away,0,English
554,In snow and mist,0,English
554,"That doesn't exist,",0,English
554,"I was going to say,",0,English

554,Yet does perhaps for all three.,0,English
554,Don't ask Joe,0,English
554,What it is to him.,0,English
554,It's sometimes dim,0,English
554,"What it is to me,",0,English
554,Unless it be,0,English
554,It's the old captain's dark fate,0,English
554,Who failed to find or force a strait,0,English
554,In its two-thousand-mile coast;,0,English

555,Brown lived at such a lofty farm,0,English
555,That everyone for miles could see,0,English
555,His lantern when he did his chores,0,English
555,In winter after half-past three.,0,English
555,And many must have seen him make,0,English
555,"His wild descent from there one night,",0,English
555,"'Cross lots, 'cross walls, 'cross everything,",0,English
555,Describing rings of lantern light.,0,English
555,Between the house and barn the gale,0,English
555,Got him by something he had on,0,English
555,And blew him out on the icy crust,0,English
555,"That cased the world, and he was gone!",0,English
555,"Walls were all buried, trees were few:",0,English
555,He saw no stay unless he stove,0,English
555,A hole in somewhere with his heel.,0,English
555,But though repeatedly he strove,0,English
555,"And stamped and said things to himself,",0,English
555,"And sometimes something seemed to yield,",0,English
555,"He gained no foothold, but pursued",0,English
555,His journey down from field to field.,0,English
555,Sometimes he came with arms outspread,0,English
555,"Like wings, revolving in the scene",0,English
555,"Upon his longer axis, and",0,English
555,With no small dignity of mien.,0,English
555,"Faster or slower as he chanced,",0,English
555,"Sitting or standing as he chose,",0,English
555,According as he feared to risk,0,English
555,"His neck, or thought to spare his clothes,",0,English
555,He never let the lantern drop.,0,English
555,And some exclaimed who saw afar,0,English
555,"The figures he described with it,",0,English
555,"""I wonder what those signals are",0,English
555,Brown makes at such an hour of night!,0,English
555,He's celebrating something strange.,0,English
555,"I wonder if he's sold his farm,",0,English
555,"Or been made Master of the Grange.""",0,English
555,"He reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;",0,English
555,He fell and made the lantern rattle,0,English
555,(But saved the light from going out.),0,English
555,So half-way down he fought the battle,0,English
555,Incredulous of his own bad luck.,0,English
555,And then becoming reconciled,0,English
555,"To everything, he gave it up",0,English
555,And came down like a coasting child.,0,English
555,"""Well-I-be-"" that was all he said,",0,English
555,"As standing in the river road,",0,English
555,He looked back up the slippery slope,0,English
555,(Two miles it was) to his abode.,0,English
555,Sometimes as an authority,0,English
555,"On motor-cars, I'm asked if I",0,English
555,"Should say our stock was petered out,",0,English
555,And this is my sincere reply:,0,English
555,Yankees are what they always were.,0,English
555,Don't think Brown ever gave up hope,0,English
555,Of getting home again because,0,English
555,He couldn't climb that slippery slope;,0,English
555,Or even thought of standing there,0,English
555,Until the January thaw,0,English
555,Should take the polish off the crust.,0,English
555,"He bowed with grace to natural law,",0,English
555,"And then went round it on his feet,",0,English
555,After the manner of our stock;,0,English
555,"Not much concerned for those to whom,",0,English
555,"At that particular time o'clock,",0,English
555,It must have looked as if the course,0,English
555,He steered was really straight away,0,English
555,From that which he was headed for -,0,English
555,"Not much concerned for them, I say:",0,English
555,No more so than became a man -,0,English
555,And politician at odd seasons.,0,English
555,I've kept Brown standing in the cold,0,English
555,While I invested him with reasons;,0,English
555,But now he snapped his eyes three times;,0,English
555,"Then shook his lantern, saying, ""Ile's",0,English
555,"'Bout out!"" and took the long way home",0,English
555,"By road, a matter of several miles.",0,English
556,A neighbor of mine in the village,0,English
556,Likes to tell how one spring,0,English
556,"When she was a girl on the farm, she did",0,English
556,A childlike thing.,0,English
556,One day she asked her father,0,English
556,To give her a garden plot,0,English
556,"To plant and tend and reap herself,",0,English
556,"And he said, 'Why not?'",0,English
556,In casting about for a corner,0,English
556,He thought of an idle bit,0,English
556,"Of walled-off ground where a shop had stood,",0,English
556,"And he said, 'Just it.'",0,English
556,"And he said, 'That ought to make you",0,English
556,"An ideal one-girl farm,",0,English
556,And give you a chance to put some strength,0,English
556,On your slim-jim arm.',0,English
556,It was not enough of a garden,0,English
556,"Her father said, to plow;",0,English
556,"So she had to work it all by hand,",1,English
556,But she don't mind now.,0,English
556,She wheeled the dung in a wheelbarrow,0,English
556,Along a stretch of road;,0,English
556,But she always ran away and left,0,English
556,"Her not-nice load,",0,English
556,And hid from anyone passing.,0,English
556,And then she begged the seed.,0,English
556,She says she thinks she planted one,0,English
556,Of all things but weed.,0,English
556,"A hill each of potatoes,",0,English
556,"Radishes, lettuce, peas,",0,English
556,"Tomatoes, beets, beans, pumpkins, corn,",0,English
556,And even fruit trees.,0,English
556,"And yes, she has long mistrusted",1,English
556,That a cider-apple,0,English
556,"In bearing there today is hers,",0,English
556,Or at least may be.,0,English
556,Her crop was a miscellany,0,English
556,"When all was said and done,",0,English
556,"A little bit of everything,",0,English
556,A great deal of none.,0,English
556,Now when she sees in the village,0,English
556,"How village things go,",0,English
556,"Just when it seems to come in right,",0,English
556,"She says, 'I know!",0,English
556,'It's as when I was a farmer...',0,English
556,Oh never by way of advice!,0,English
556,And she never sins by telling the tale,0,English
556,To the same person twice.,0,English
557,"But outer Space,",0,English
557,"At least this far,",0,English
557,For all the fuss,0,English
557,Of the populace,0,English
557,Stays more popular,0,English
557,Than populous,0,English
558,To think to know the country and now know,0,English
558,The hillside on the day the sun lets go,0,English
558,Ten million silver lizards out of snow!,0,English
558,As often as I've seen it done before,0,English
558,I can't pretend to tell the way it's done.,0,English
558,It looks as if some magic of the sun,0,English
558,Lifted the rug that bred them on the floor,0,English
558,And the light breaking on them made them run.,0,English
558,"But if I though to stop the wet stampede,",0,English
558,"And caught one silver lizard by the tail,",0,English
558,"And put my foot on one without avail,",0,English
558,And threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed,0,English
558,"In front of twenty others' wriggling speed,-",0,English
558,"In the confusion of them all aglitter,",0,English
558,And birds that joined in the excited fun,0,English
558,"By doubling and redoubling song and twitter,",0,English
558,I have no doubt I'd end by holding none.,0,English
558,It takes the moon for this. The sun's a wizard,0,English
558,By all I tell; but so's the moon a witch.,0,English
558,From the high west she makes a gentle cast,0,English
558,"And suddenly, without a jerk or twitch,",0,English
558,She has her speel on every single lizard.,0,English
558,I fancied when I looked at six o'clock,0,English
558,The swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast.,0,English
558,The moon was waiting for her chill effect.,0,English
558,I looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock,0,English
558,"In every lifelike posture of the swarm,",0,English
558,Transfixed on mountain slopes almost erect.,0,English
558,Across each other and side by side they lay.,0,English
558,The spell that so could hold them as they were,0,English
558,Was wrought through trees without a breath of storm,0,English
558,"To make a leaf, if there had been one, stir.",0,English
558,One lizard at the end of every ray.,0,English
558,The thought of my attempting such a stray!,0,English
559,I didn't make you know how glad I was,0,English
559,To have you come and camp here on our land.,0,English
559,I promised myself to get down some day,0,English
559,"And see the way you lived, but I don't know!",0,English
559,With a houseful of hungry men to feed,0,English
559,I guess you'd find.... It seems to me,0,English
559,I can't express my feelings any more,0,English
559,Than I can raise my voice or want to lift,0,English
559,"My hand (oh, I can lift it when I have to).",0,English
559,Did ever you feel so? I hope you never.,0,English
559,It's got so I don't even know for sure,0,English
559,"Whether I am glad, sorry, or anything.",0,English
559,There's nothing but a voice-like left inside,0,English
559,"That seems to tell me how I ought to feel,",0,English
559,And would feel if I wasn't all gone wrong.,0,English
559,You take the lake. I look and look at it.,0,English
559,"I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water.",0,English
559,I stand and make myself repeat out loud,0,English
559,"The advantages it has, so long and narrow,",0,English
559,Like a deep piece of some old running river,0,English
559,Cut short off at both ends. It lies five miles,0,English
559,Straight away through the mountain notch,0,English
559,"From the sink window where I wash the plates,",0,English
559,"And all our storms come up toward the house,",0,English
559,Drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter.,0,English
559,It took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit,0,English
559,To step outdoors and take the water dazzle,0,English
559,"A sunny morning, or take the rising wind",0,English
559,"About my face and body and through my wrapper,",0,English
559,"When a storm threatened from the Dragon's Den,",0,English
559,And a cold chill shivered across the lake.,0,English
559,"I see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,",0,English
559,Our Willoughby! How did you hear of it?,0,English
559,"I expect, though, everyone's heard of it.",0,English
559,In a book about ferns? Listen to that!,0,English
559,You let things more like feathers regulate,0,English
559,Your going and coming. And you like it here?,0,English
559,I can see how you might. But I don't know!,0,English
559,"It would be different if more people came,",0,English
559,"For then there would be business. As it is,",0,English
559,"The cottages Len built, sometimes we rent them,",0,English
559,Sometimes we don't. We've a good piece of shore,0,English
559,"That ought to be worth something, and may yet.",0,English
559,But I don't count on it as much as Len.,0,English
559,"He looks on the bright side of everything,",0,English
559,Including me. He thinks I'll be all right,0,English
559,With doctoring. But it's not medicine -,0,English
559,Lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so -,0,English
559,"It's rest I want - there, I have said it out -",0,English
559,From cooking meals for hungry hired men,0,English
559,And washing dishes after them - from doing,0,English
559,Things over and over that just won't stay done.,0,English
559,By good rights I ought not to have so much,0,English
559,"Put on me, but there seems no other way.",0,English
559,Len says one steady pull more ought to do it.,0,English
559,He says the best way out is always through.,0,English
559,"And I agree to that, or in so far",0,English
559,As that I can see no way out but through -,0,English
559,Leastways for me - and then they'll be convinced.,0,English
559,It's not that Len don't want the best for me.,0,English
559,It was his plan our moving over in,0,English
559,Beside the lake from where that day I showed you,0,English
559,We used to live - ten miles from anywhere.,0,English
559,"We didn't change without some sacrifice,",0,English
559,But Len went at it to make up the loss.,0,English
559,"His work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,",0,English
559,But he works when he works as hard as I do -,0,English
559,Though there's small profit in comparisons.,0,English
559,(Women and men will make them all the same.),0,English
559,But work ain't all. Len undertakes too much.,0,English
559,He's into everything in town. This year,0,English
559,"It's highways, and he's got too many men",0,English
559,Around him to look after that make waste.,0,English
559,"They take advantage of him shamefully,",0,English
559,"And proud, too, of themselves for doing so.",0,English
559,"We have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,",0,English
559,Sprawling about the kitchen with their talk,0,English
559,While I fry their bacon. Much they care!,0,English
559,No more put out in what they do or say,0,English
559,Than if I wasn't in the room at all.,0,English
559,"Coming and going all the time, they are:",0,English
559,"I don't learn what their names are, let alone",0,English
559,"Their characters, or whether they are safe",0,English
559,To have inside the house with doors unlocked.,0,English
559,"I'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not",0,English
559,Afraid of me. There's two can play at that.,0,English
559,I have my fancies: it runs in the family.,0,English
559,My father's brother wasn't right. They kept him,0,English
559,Locked up for years back there at the old farm.,0,English
559,"I've been away once - yes, I've been away.",0,English
559,The State Asylum. I was prejudiced;,0,English
559,I wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;,0,English
559,You know the old idea - the only asylum,0,English
559,"Was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,",0,English
559,"Rather than send their folks to such a place,",0,English
559,Kept them at home; and it does seem more human.,0,English
559,But it's not so: the place is the asylum.,0,English
559,"There they have every means proper to do with,",0,English
559,And you aren't darkening other people's lives -,0,English
559,"Worse than no good to them, and they no good",0,English
559,To you in your condition; you can't know,0,English
559,Affection or the want of it in that state.,0,English
559,I've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.,0,English
559,"My father's brother, he went mad quite young.",0,English
559,"Some thought he had been bitten by a dog,",0,English
559,Because his violence took on the form,0,English
559,Of carrying his pillow in his teeth;,0,English
559,"But it's more likely he was crossed in love,",0,English
559,Or so the story goes. It was some girl.,0,English
559,Anyway all he talked about was love.,0,English
559,They soon saw he would do someone a mischief,0,English
559,"If he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended",0,English
559,"In father's building him a sort of cage,",0,English
559,"Or room within a room, of hickory poles,",0,English
559,"Like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling, -",0,English
559,A narrow passage all the way around.,0,English
559,Anything they put in for furniture,0,English
559,"He'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.",0,English
559,"So they made the place comfortable with straw,",0,English
559,"Like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.",0,English
559,Of course they had to feed him without dishes.,0,English
559,"They tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded",0,English
559,With his clothes on his arm - all of his clothes.,0,English
559,Cruel - it sounds. I 'spose they did the best,0,English
559,"They knew. And just when he was at the height,",0,English
559,"Father and mother married, and mother came,",0,English
559,"A bride, to help take care of such a creature,",0,English
559,And accommodate her young life to his.,1,English
559,That was what marrying father meant to her.,0,English
559,She had to lie and hear love things made dreadful,1,English
559,By his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout,0,English
559,"Until the strength was shouted out of him,",0,English
559,And his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.,0,English
559,"He'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,",0,English
559,And let them go and make them twang until,0,English
559,His hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.,0,English
559,And then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play -,0,English
559,"The only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,",0,English
559,They found a way to put a stop to it.,0,English
559,He was before my time - I never saw him;,0,English
559,But the pen stayed exactly as it was,0,English
559,"There in the upper chamber in the ell,",0,English
559,A sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.,0,English
559,I often think of the smooth hickory bars.,0,English
559,"It got so I would say - you know, half fooling -",0,English
559,"""It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail"" -",0,English
559,Just as you will till it becomes a habit.,0,English
559,No wonder I was glad to get away.,0,English
559,"Mind you, I waited till Len said the word.",0,English
559,I didn't want the blame if things went wrong.,0,English
559,"I was glad though, no end, when we moved out,",0,English
559,"And I looked to be happy, and I was,",0,English
559,"As I said, for a while - but I don't know!",0,English
559,Somehow the change wore out like a prescription.,0,English
559,And there's more to it than just window-views,0,English
559,And living by a lake. I'm past such help -,0,English
559,"Unless Len took the notion, which he won't,",0,English
559,And I won't ask him - it's not sure enough.,0,English
559,I 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going:,0,English
559,"Other folks have to, and why shouldn't I?",0,English
559,"I almost think if I could do like you,",0,English
559,Drop everything and live out on the ground -,0,English
559,"But it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it,",0,English
559,"Or a long rain. I should soon get enough,",0,English
559,And be glad of a good roof overhead.,0,English
559,"I've lain awake thinking of you, I'll warrant,",0,English
559,"More than you have yourself, some of these nights.",0,English
559,The wonder was the tents weren't snatched away,0,English
559,From over you as you lay in your beds.,0,English
559,I haven't courage for a risk like that.,0,English
559,"Bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,",0,English
559,"But the thing of it is, I need to be kept.",0,English
559,There's work enough to do - there's always that;,0,English
559,But behind's behind. The worst that you can do,0,English
559,Is set me back a little more behind.,0,English
559,"I sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway.",0,English
559,I'd rather you'd not go unless you must.,0,English
560,The great Overdog,0,English
560,That heavenly beast,0,English
560,With a star in one eye,0,English
560,Gives a leap in the east.,0,English
560,He dances upright,0,English
560,All the way to the west,0,English
560,And never once drops,0,English
560,On his forefeet to rest.,0,English
560,"I'm a poor underdog,",0,English
560,But to-night I will bark,0,English
560,With the great Overdog,0,English
560,That romps through the dark.,0,English
561,"One of my wishes is that those dark trees,",0,English
561,"So old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,",0,English
561,"Were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,",0,English
561,But stretched away unto the edge of doom.,0,English
561,I should not be withheld but that some day,0,English
561,"Into their vastness I should steal away,",0,English
561,"Fearless of ever finding open land,",0,English
561,Or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand.,0,English
561,"I do not see why I should e'er turn back,",0,English
561,Or those should not set forth upon my track,0,English
561,"To overtake me, who should miss me here",0,English
561,And long to know if still I held them dear.,0,English
561,They would not find me changed from him they knew--,0,English
561,Only more sure of all I thought was true.,0,English
562,"It is blue-butterfly day here in spring,",0,English
562,And with these sky-flakes down in flurry on flurry,0,English
562,There is more unmixed color on the wing,0,English
562,Than flowers will show for days unless they hurry.,0,English
562,But these are flowers that fly and all but sing:,0,English
562,And now from having ridden out desire,0,English
562,They lie closed over in the wind and cling,0,English
562,Where wheels have freshly sliced the April mire.,0,English
563,Why make so much of fragmentary blue,0,English
563,"In here and there a bird, or butterfly,",0,English
563,"Or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,",0,English
563,When heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?,0,English
563,"Since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet)--",0,English
563,Though some savants make earth include the sky;,0,English
563,"And blue so far above us comes so high,",0,English
563,It only gives our wish for blue a whet.,0,English
564,"The well was dry beside the door,",0,English
564,And so we went with pail and can,0,English
564,Across the fields behind the house,0,English
564,To seek the brook if still it ran;,0,English
564,"Not loth to have excuse to go,",0,English
564,Because the autumn eve was fair,0,English
564,"(Though chill), because the fields were ours,",0,English
564,And by the brook our woods were there.,0,English
564,We ran as if to meet the moon,0,English
564,"That slowly dawned behind the trees,",0,English
564,"The barren boughs without the leaves,",0,English
564,"Without the birds, without the breeze.",0,English
564,"But once within the wood, we paused",0,English
564,"Like gnomes that hid us from the moon,",0,English
564,Ready to run to hiding new,0,English
564,With laughter when she found us soon.,0,English
564,Each laid on other a staying hand,0,English
564,"To listen ere we dared to look,",0,English
564,And in the hush we joined to make,0,English
564,"We heard, we knew we heard the brook.",0,English
564,"A note as from a single place,",0,English
564,A slender tinkling fail that made,0,English
564,Now drops that floated on the pool,0,English
564,"Like pearls, and now a silver blade.",0,English
565,"A Stranger came to the door at eve,",0,English
565,And he spoke the bridegroom fair.,0,English
565,"He bore a green-white stick in his hand,",0,English
565,"And, for all burden, care.",0,English
565,He asked with the eyes more than the lips,0,English
565,"For a shelter for the night,",0,English
565,And he turned and looked at the road afar,0,English
565,Without a window light.,0,English
565,The bridegroom came forth into the porch,0,English
565,"With, 'Let us look at the sky,",0,English
565,"And question what of the night to be,",0,English
565,"Stranger, you and I.'",0,English
565,"The woodbine leaves littered the yard,",0,English
565,"The woodbine berries were blue,",0,English
565,"Autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;",0,English
565,"'Stranger, I wish I knew.'",0,English
565,"Within, the bride in the dusk alone",0,English
565,"Bent over the open fire,",0,English
565,Her face rose-red with the glowing coal,0,English
565,And the thought of the heart's desire.,0,English
565,"The bridegroom looked at the weary road,",0,English
565,"Yet saw but her within,",0,English
565,And wished her heart in a case of gold,0,English
565,And pinned with a silver pin.,0,English
565,The bridegroom thought it little to give,0,English
565,"A dole of bread, a purse,",0,English
565,"A heartfelt prayer for the poor of God,",0,English
565,Or for the rich a curse;,0,English
565,But whether or not a man was asked,0,English
565,To mar the love of two,0,English
565,"By harboring woe in the bridal house,",0,English
565,The bridegroom wished he knew.,0,English
566,"O hushed October morning mild,",0,English
566,"Thy leaves have ripened to the fall;
Tomorrow's wind, if it be wild,",0,English
566,Should waste them all.,0,English
566,The crows above the forest call;,0,English
566,Tomorrow they may form and go.,0,English
566,"O hushed October morning mild,",0,English
566,Begin the hours of this day slow.,0,English
566,Make the day seem to us less brief.,0,English
566,"Hearts not averse to being beguiled,",0,English
566,Beguile us in the way you know.,0,English
566,Release one leaf at break of day;,0,English
566,At noon release another leaf;,0,English
566,"One from our trees, one far away.",0,English
566,Retard the sun with gentle mist;,0,English
566,Enchant the land with amethyst.,0,English
566,"Slow, slow!",0,English
566,"For the grapes' sake, if they were all,",0,English
566,"Whose leaves already are burnt with frost,",0,English
566,Whose clustered fruit must else be lost--,0,English
566,For the grapes' sake along the wall.,0,English
567,The shattered water made a misty din.,0,English
567,"Great waves looked over others coming in,",0,English
567,And thought of doing something to the shore,0,English
567,That water never did to land before.,0,English
567,"The clouds were low and hairy in the skies,",0,English
567,Like locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes.,0,English
567,"You could not tell, and yet it looked as if",0,English
567,"The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff,",0,English
567,The cliff in being backed by continent;,0,English
567,It looked as if a night of dark intent,0,English
567,"Was coming, and not only a night, an age.",0,English
567,Someone had better be prepared for rage.,0,English
567,There would be more than ocean-water broken,0,English
567,Before God's last Put out the Light was spoken.,0,English
568,"These pools that, though in forests, still reflect",0,English
568,"The total sky almost without defect,",0,English
568,"And like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver,",0,English
568,"Will like the flowers beside them soon be gone,",0,English
568,"And yet not out by any brook or river,",0,English
568,But up by roots to bring dark foliage on.,0,English
568,The trees that have it in their pent-up buds,0,English
568,To darken nature and be summer woods --,0,English
568,Let them think twice before they use their powers,0,English
568,To blot out and drink up and sweep away,0,English
568,These flowery waters and these watery flowers,0,English
568,From snow that melted only yesterday.,0,English
569,For every parcel I stoop down to seize,0,English
569,"I lose some other off my arms and knees,",0,English
569,"And the whole pile is slipping, bottles, buns,",0,English
569,Extremes too hard to comprehend at. once,0,English
569,Yet nothing I should care to leave behind.,0,English
569,With all I have to hold with hand and mind,0,English
569,"And heart, if need be, I will do my best.",0,English
569,To keep their building balanced at my breast.,0,English
569,I crouch down to prevent them as they fall;,0,English
569,Then sit down in the middle of them all.,0,English
569,I had to drop the armful in the road,0,English
569,And try to stack them in a better load.,0,English
570,The bear puts both arms around the tree above her,0,English
570,And draws it down as if it were a lover,0,English
570,"And its choke cherries lips to kiss good-bye,",0,English
570,Then lets it snap back upright in the sky.,0,English
570,Her next step rocks a boulder on the wall,0,English
570,(She's making her cross-country in the fall).,0,English
570,Her great weight creaks the barbed-wire in its staples,0,English
570,"As she flings over and off down through the maples,",0,English
570,Leaving on one wire moth a lock of hair.,0,English
570,Such is the uncaged progress of the bear.,0,English
570,The world has room to make a bear feel free;,0,English
570,The universe seems cramped to you and me.,0,English
570,Man acts more like the poor bear in a cage,0,English
570,That all day fights a nervous inward rage,0,English
570,His mood rejecting all his mind suggests.,0,English
570,He paces back and forth and never rests,0,English
570,"The me-nail click and shuffle of his feet,",0,English
570,The telescope at one end of his beat,0,English
570,"And at the other end the microscope,",0,English
570,"Two instruments of nearly equal hope,",0,English
570,And in conjunction giving quite a spread.,0,English
570,"Or if he rests from scientific tread,",0,English
570,'Tis only to sit back and sway his head,0,English
570,"Through ninety odd degrees of arc, it seems,",0,English
570,Between two metaphysical extremes.,0,English
570,He sits back on his fundamental butt,0,English
570,"With lifted snout and eyes (if any) shut,",0,English
570,"(lie almost looks religious but he's not),",0,English
570,"And back and forth he sways from cheek to cheek,",0,English
570,At one extreme agreeing with one Greek,0,English
570,At the other agreeing with another Greek,0,English
570,"Which may be thought, but only so to speak.",0,English
570,"A baggy figure, equally pathetic",0,English
570,When sedentary and when peripatetic.,0,English
571,Something inspires the only cow of late,0,English
571,"To make no more of a wall than an open gate,",0,English
571,And think no more of wall-builders than fools.,0,English
571,Her face is flecked with pomace and she drools,0,English
571,"A cider syrup. Having tasted fruit,",0,English
571,She scorns a pasture withering to the root.,0,English
571,She runs from tree to tree where lie and sweeten.,0,English
571,The windfalls spiked with stubble and worm-eaten.,0,English
571,She leaves them bitten when she has to fly.,0,English
571,She bellows on a knoll against the sky.,0,English
571,Her udder shrivels and the milk goes dry.,0,English
572,LONELINESS,0,English
572,(Her Word),0,English
572,One ought not to have to care,0,English
572,So much as you and I,0,English
572,Care when the birds come round the house,0,English
572,To seem to say good-bye;,0,English
572,Or care so much when they come back,0,English
572,With whatever it is they sing;,0,English
572,The truth being we are as much,0,English
572,Too glad for the one thing,0,English
572,As we are too sad for the other here --,0,English
572,With birds that fill their breasts,0,English
572,But with each other and themselves,0,English
572,And their built or driven nests.,0,English
572,HOUSE FEAR,0,English
572,Always -- I tell you this they learned--,0,English
572,Always at night when they returned,0,English
572,To the lonely house from far away,0,English
572,"To lamps unlighted and fire gone gray,",0,English
572,They learned to rattle the lock and key,0,English
572,To give whatever might chance to be,0,English
572,Warning and time to be off in flight:,0,English
572,"And preferring the out- to the in-door night,",0,English
572,They. learned to leave the house-door wide,0,English
572,Until they had lit the lamp inside.,0,English
572,THE SMILE,0,English
572,(Her Word),0,English
572,I didn't like the way he went away.,0,English
572,That smile! It never came of being gay.,0,English
572,Still he smiled- did you see him?- I was sure!,0,English
572,Perhaps because we gave him only bread,0,English
572,And the wretch knew from that that we were poor.,0,English
572,Perhaps because he let us give instead,0,English
572,Of seizing from us as he might have seized.,0,English
572,"Perhaps he mocked at us for being wed,",0,English
572,Or being very young (and he was pleased,0,English
572,To have a vision of us old and dead).,0,English
572,I wonder how far down the road he's got.,0,English
572,He's watching from the woods as like as not.,0,English
572,THE OFT-REPEATED DREAM,0,English
572,She had no saying dark enough,0,English
572,For the dark pine that kept,0,English
572,Forever trying the window-latch,0,English
572,Of the room where they slept.,0,English
572,The tireless but ineffectual hands,0,English
572,That with every futile pass,0,English
572,Made the great tree seem as a little bird,0,English
572,Before the mystery of glass!,0,English
572,"It never had been inside the room,",0,English
572,And only one of the two,0,English
572,Was afraid in an oft-repeated dream,0,English
572,Of what the tree might do.,0,English
572,THE IMPULSE,0,English
572,"It was too lonely for her there,",0,English
572,"And too wild,",0,English
572,"And since there were but two of them,",0,English
572,"And no child,",0,English
572,"And work was little in the house,",0,English
572,"She was free,",0,English
572,"And followed where he furrowed field,",0,English
572,Or felled tree.,0,English
572,She rested on a log and tossed,0,English
572,"The fresh chips,",0,English
572,With a song only to herself,0,English
572,On her lips.,0,English
572,And once she went to break a bough,0,English
572,Of black alder.,0,English
572,"She strayed so far she scarcely heard.
When he called her--",0,English
572,And didn't answer -- didn't speak --,0,English
572,Or return.,0,English
572,"She stood, and then she ran and hid",0,English
572,In the fern.,0,English
572,"He never found her, though he looked",0,English
572,"Everywhere,",0,English
572,And he asked at her mother's house,0,English
572,Was she there.,0,English
572,Sudden and swift and light as that,0,English
572,"The ties gave,",0,English
572,And he learned of finalities,0,English
572,Besides the grave.,0,English
573,The way a crow,0,English
573,Shook down on me,0,English
573,The dust of snow,0,English
573,From a hemlock tree,0,English
573,Has given my heart,0,English
573,A change of mood,0,English
573,And saved some part,0,English
573,Of a day I had rued.,0,English
574,"Here come real stars to fill the upper skies,",0,English
574,"And here on earth come emulating flies,",0,English
574,"That though they never equal stars in size,",0,English
574,(And they were never really stars at heart),0,English
574,Achieve at times a very star-like start.,0,English
574,"Only, of course, they can't sustain the part.",0,English
574,I Dwell in a lonely house I know,0,English
574,"That vanished many a summer ago,",0,English
574,"And left no trace but the cellar walls,",0,English
574,"And a cellar in which the daylight falls,",0,English
574,And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow.,0,English
574,O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield,0,English
574,The woods come back to the mowing field;,0,English
574,The orchard tree has grown one copse,0,English
574,Of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops;,0,English
574,The footpath down to the well is healed.,0,English
574,I dwell with a strangely aching heart,0,English
574,In that vanished abode there far apart,0,English
574,On that disused and forgotten road,0,English
574,That has no dust-bath now for the toad.,0,English
574,Night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;,0,English
574,The whippoorwill is coming to shout,0,English
574,And hush and cluck and flutter about:,0,English
574,I hear him begin far enough away,0,English
574,Full many a time to say his say,0,English
574,Before he arrives to say it out.,0,English
574,"It is under the small, dim, summer star.",0,English
574,I know not who these mute folk are,0,English
574,Who share the unlit place with me--,0,English
574,Those stones out under the low-limbed tree,0,English
574,Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar.,0,English
574,"They are tireless folk, but slow and sad,",0,English
574,"Though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,--",0,English
574,"With none among them that ever sings,",0,English
574,"And yet, in view of how many things,",0,English
574,As sweet companions as might be had.,0,English
575,Now close the windows and hush all the fields:,0,English
575,"If the trees must, let them silently toss;",0,English
575,"No bird is singing in them now, and if there is,",0,English
575,Be it my loss.,0,English

582,Mrs. Baptiste came in and rocked a chair,0,English
582,That had as many motions as the world:,0,English
582,"One back and forward, in and out of shadow,",0,English
582,"That got her nowhere; one more gradual,",0,English
582,"Sideways, that would have run her on the stove",0,English
582,"In time, had she not realized her danger",0,English
582,"And caught herself up bodily, chair and all,",0,English
582,"And set herself back where she ,started from.",0,English
582,'She ain't spick too much Henglish- dat's too bad.',1,English
582,"I was afraid, in brightening first on me,",0,English
582,"Then on Baptiste, as if she understood",0,English
582,"'What passed between us, she was only reigning.",0,English
582,Baptiste was anxious for her; but no more,0,English
582,"Than for himself, so placed he couldn't hope",0,English
582,To keep his bargain of the morning with me,0,English
582,In time to keep me from suspecting him,0,English
582,Of really never having meant to keep it.,0,English
582,"Needlessly soon he had his axe-helves out,",0,English
582,"A quiverful to choose from, since he wished me",0,English
582,"To have the best he had, or had to spare --",0,English
582,"Not for me to ask which, when what he took",0,English
582,Had beauties he had to point me out at length,0,English
582,To ensure their not being wasted on me.,0,English
582,"He liked to have it slender as a whipstock,",0,English
582,"Free from the least knot, equal to the strain",0,English
582,Of bending like a sword across the knee.,0,English
582,He showed me that the lines of a good helve,0,English
582,Were native to the grain before the knife,0,English
582,"Expressed them, and its curves were no false curves",0,English
582,Put on it from without. And there its strength lay,0,English
582,For the hard work. He chafed its long white body,0,English
582,>From end to end with his rough hand shut round it.,0,English
582,He tried it at the eye-hold in the axe-head.,0,English
582,"'Hahn, hahn,' he mused, 'don't need much taking down.'",0,English
582,Baptiste knew how to make a short job long,0,English
582,"For love of it, and yet not waste time either.",0,English
582,"Do you know, what we talked about was knowledge?",0,English
582,Baptiste on his defence about the children,0,English
582,"He kept from school, or did his best to keep --",0,English
582,Whatever school and children and our doubts,0,English
582,Of laid-on education had to do,0,English
582,With the curves of his axe-helves and his having,0,English
582,Used these unscrupulously to bring me,0,English
582,To see for once the inside of his house.,0,English
582,"Was I desired in friendship, partly as some one",0,English
582,"To leave it to, whether the right to hold",0,English
582,Such doubts of education should depend,0,English
582,Upon the education of those who held them.,0,English
582,But now he brushed the shavings from his knee,0,English
582,"And stood the axe there on its horse's hoof,",0,English
582,"Erect, but not without its waves, as when",0,English
582,The snake stood up for evil in the Garden'-,0,English
582,"Top-heavy with a heaviness his short,",0,English
582,"Thick hand made light of, steel-blue chin drawn down",0,English
582,And in a little -- a French touch in that.,0,English
582,"Baptiste drew back and squinted at it, pleased;",0,English
582,'See how she's cock her head',0,English
583,There were three in the meadow by the brook,0,English
583,"Gathering up windrows, piling cocks of hay,",0,English
583,With an eye always lifted toward the west,0,English
583,Where an irregular sun-bordered cloud,0,English
583,Darkly advanced with a perpetual dagger,0,English
583,Flickering across its bosom. Suddenly,0,English
583,"One helper, thrusting pitchfork in the ground,",0,English
583,Marched himself off the field and home. One stayed.,0,English
583,The town-bred farmer failed to understand.,0,English
583,"""What is there wrong?""",0,English
583,"""Something you just now said.""",0,English
583,"""What did I say?""",0,English
583,"""About our taking pains.""",0,English
583,"""To cock the hay?--because it's going to shower?",0,English
583,I said that more than half an hour ago.,0,English
583,"I said it to myself as much as you.""",0,English
583,"""You didn't know. But James is one big fool.",0,English
583,He thought you meant to find fault with his work.,0,English
583,That's what the average farmer would have meant.,0,English
583,"James would take time, of course, to chew it over",0,English
583,"Before he acted: he's just got round to act.""",0,English
583,"""He is a fool if that's the way he takes me.""",0,English
583,"""Don't let it bother you. You've found out something.",0,English
583,The hand that knows his business won't be told,0,English
583,To do work better or faster--those two things.,0,English
583,I'm as particular as anyone:,0,English
583,Most likely I'd have served you just the same.,0,English
583,But I know you don't understand our ways.,0,English
583,"You were just talking what was in your mind, v
What was in all our minds, and you weren't hinting.",0,English
583,Tell you a story of what happened once:,0,English
583,I was up here in Salem at a man's,0,English
583,Named Sanders with a gang of four or five,0,English
583,Doing the haying. No one liked the boss.,0,English
583,"He was one of the kind sports call a spider,",0,English
583,All wiry arms and legs that spread out wavy,0,English
583,From a humped body nigh as big's a biscuit.,0,English
583,"But work! that man could work, especially",0,English
583,If by so doing he could get more work,0,English
583,Out of his hired help. I'm not denying,0,English
583,He was hard on himself. I couldn't find,0,English
583,That he kept any hours--not for himself.,0,English
583,Daylight and lantern-light were one to him:,0,English
583,I've heard him pounding in the barn all night.,0,English
583,But what he liked was someone to encourage.,0,English
583,Them that he couldn't lead he'd get behind,0,English
583,"And drive, the way you can, you know, in mowing--",0,English
583,Keep at their heels and threaten to mow their legs off.,0,English
583,I'd seen about enough of his bulling tricks,0,English
583,(We call that bulling). I'd been watching him.,0,English
583,So when he paired off with me in the hayfield,0,English
583,"To load the load, thinks I, Look out for trouble.",0,English
583,I built the load and topped it off; old Sanders,0,English
583,"Combed it down with a rake and says, 'O. K.'",0,English
583,Everything went well till we reached the barn,0,English
583,With a big catch to empty in a bay.,0,English
583,You understand that meant the easy job,0,English
583,For the man up on top of throwing down,0,English
583,"The hay and rolling it off wholesale,",0,English
583,Where on a mow it would have been slow lifting.,0,English
583,You wouldn't think a fellow'd need much urging,0,English
583,"Under these circumstances, would you now?",0,English
583,"But the old fool seizes his fork in both hands,",0,English
583,"And looking up bewhiskered out of the pit,",0,English
583,"Shouts like an army captain, 'Let her come!'",0,English
583,"Thinks I, D'ye mean it? 'What was that you said?'",0,English
583,"I asked out loud, so's there'd be no mistake,",0,English
583,"'Did you say, Let her come?' 'Yes, let her come.'",0,English
583,"He said it over, but he said it softer.",0,English
583,"Never you say a thing like that to a man,",0,English
583,"Not if he values what he is. God, I'd as soon",0,English
583,Murdered him as left out his middle name.,0,English
583,I'd built the load and knew right where to find it.,0,English
583,Two or three forkfuls I picked lightly round for,0,English
583,"Like meditating, and then I just dug in",0,English
583,And dumped the rackful on him in ten lots.,0,English
583,I looked over the side once in the dust,0,English
583,"And caught sight of him treading-water-like,",0,English
583,"Keeping his head above. 'Damn ye,' I says,",0,English
583,'That gets ye!' He squeaked like a squeezed rat.,0,English
583,That was the last I saw or heard of him.,0,English
583,I cleaned the rack and drove out to cool off.,0,English
583,"As I sat mopping hayseed from my neck,",0,English
583,"And sort of waiting to be asked about it,",0,English
583,"One of the boys sings out, 'Where's the old man?'",0,English
583,'I left him in the barn under the hay.,0,English
583,"If ye want him, ye can go and dig him out.'",0,English
583,They realized from the way I swobbed my neck,0,English
583,More than was needed something must be up.,0,English
583,They headed for the barn; I stayed where I was.,0,English
583,"They told me afterward. First they forked hay,",0,English
583,"A lot of it, out into the barn floor.",0,English
583,Nothing! They listened for him. Not a rustle.,0,English
583,I guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple,0,English
583,"Before I buried him, or I couldn't have managed.",0,English
583,They excavated more. 'Go keep his wife,1,English
583,"Out of the barn.' Someone looked in a window,",0,English
583,And curse me if he wasn't in the kitchen,0,English
583,"Slumped way down in a chair, with both his feet",0,English
583,"Stuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer.",0,English
583,He looked so clean disgusted from behind,0,English
583,"There was no one that dared to stir him up,",0,English
583,Or let him know that he was being looked at.,0,English
583,Apparently I hadn't buried him,0,English
583,(I may have knocked him down); but my just trying,0,English
583,To bury him had hurt his dignity.,0,English
583,He had gone to the house so's not to meet me.,0,English
583,He kept away from us all afternoon.,0,English
583,We tended to his hay. We saw him out,0,English
583,After a while picking peas in his garden:,0,English
583,"He couldn't keep away from doing something.""",0,English
583,"""Weren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?""",0,English
583,"""No! and yet I don't know--it's hard to say.",0,English
583,"I went about to kill him fair enough.""",0,English
583,"""You took an awkward way. Did he discharge you?""",0,English
583,"""Discharge me? No! He knew I did just right.""",0,English
584,He is said to have been the last Red man,0,English
584,In Action. And the Miller is said to have laughed--,0,English
584,If you like to call such a sound a laugh.,0,English
584,But he gave no one else a laugher's license.,0,English
584,"For he turned suddenly grave as if to say,",0,English
584,"'Whose business,--if I take it on myself,",0,English
584,Whose business--but why talk round the barn?--,0,English
584,When it's just that I hold with getting a thing done with.',0,English
584,You can't get back and see it as he saw it.,0,English
584,It's too long a story to go into now.,0,English
584,You'd have to have been there and lived it.,0,English
584,They you wouldn't have looked on it as just a matter,0,English
584,Of who began it between the two races.,0,English
584,Some guttural exclamation of surprise,0,English
584,The Red man gave in poking about the mill,0,English
584,Over the great big thumping shuffling millstone,0,English
584,Disgusted the Miller physically as coming,0,English
584,From one who had no right to be heard from.,0,English
584,"'Come, John,' he said, 'you want to see the wheel-pint?'",0,English
584,"He took him down below a cramping rafter,",0,English
584,"And showed him, through a manhole in the floor,",0,English
584,"The water in desperate straits like frantic fish,",0,English
584,"Salmon and sturgeon, lashing with their tails.",0,English
584,The he shut down the trap door with a ring in it,0,English
584,"That jangled even above the general noise,",0,English
584,"And came upstairs alone--and gave that laugh,",0,English
584,And said something to a man with a meal-sack,0,English
584,That the man with the meal-sack didn't catch--then.,0,English
584,"Oh, yes, he showed John the wheel-pit all right.",0,English
585,"Once when the snow of the year was beginning to fall,",0,English
585,We stopped by a mountain pasture to say 'Whose colt?',0,English
585,"A little Morgan had one forefoot on the wall,",0,English
585,The other curled at his breast. He dipped his head,0,English
585,And snorted at us. And then he had to bolt.,0,English
585,"We heard the miniature thunder where he fled,",0,English
585,"And we saw him, or thought we saw him, dim and grey,",0,English
585,Like a shadow against the curtain of falling flakes.,0,English
585,'I think the little fellow's afraid of the snow.,0,English
585,He isn't winter-broken. It isn't play,0,English
585,With the little fellow at all. He's running away.,0,English
585,"I doubt if even his mother could tell him, ""Sakes,",0,English
585,"It's only weather"". He'd think she didn't know !",0,English
585,Where is his mother? He can't be out alone.',0,English
585,And now he comes again with a clatter of stone,0,English
585,And mounts the wall again with whited eyes,0,English
585,And all his tail that isn't hair up straight.,0,English
585,He shudders his coat as if to throw off flies.,0,English
585,"'Whoever it is that leaves him out so late,",0,English
585,"When other creatures have gone to stall and bin,",0,English
585,Ought to be told to come and take him in.',0,English
586,I staid the night for shelter at a farm,0,English
586,"Behind the mountains, with a mother and son,",0,English
586,Two old-believers. They did all the talking.,0,English
586,MOTHER Folks think a witch who has familiar spirits,0,English
586,"She could call up to pass a winter evening,",0,English
586,"But won't, should be burned at the stake or something.",0,English
586,"Summoning spirits isn't 'Button, button,",0,English
586,"Who's got the button,' I would have them know.",0,English
586,SON: Mother can make a common table rear,0,English
586,And kick with two legs like an army mule.,0,English
586,"MOTHER: And when I've done it, what good have I done?",0,English
586,"Rather than tip a table for you, let me",0,English
586,Tell you what Ralle the Sioux Control once told me.,0,English
586,"He said the dead had souls, but when I asked him",0,English
586,"How could that be -- I thought the dead were souls,",0,English
586,He broke my trance. Don't that make you suspicious,0,English
586,That there's something the dead are keeping back?,0,English
586,"Yes, there's something the dead are keeping back.",0,English
586,SON: You wouldn't want to tell him what we have,0,English
586,"Up attic, mother?",0,English
586,MOTHER: Bones -- a skeleton.,0,English
586,SON: But the headboard of mother's bed is pushed,0,English
586,Against the' attic door: the door is nailed.,0,English
586,It's harmless. Mother hears it in the night,0,English
586,Halting perplexed behind the barrier,0,English
586,Of door and headboard. Where it wants to get,0,English
586,Is back into the cellar where it came from.,0,English
586,"MOTHER: We'll never let them, will we, son! We'll never !",0,English
586,SON: It left the cellar forty years ago,0,English
586,And carried itself like a pile of dishes,0,English
586,"Up one flight from the cellar to the kitchen,",0,English
586,"Another from the kitchen to the bedroom,",0,English
586,"Another from the bedroom to the attic,",0,English
586,"Right past both father and mother, and neither stopped it.",0,English
586,Father had gone upstairs; mother was downstairs.,0,English
586,I was a baby: I don't know where I was.,0,English
586,MOTHER: The only fault my husband found with me --,0,English
586,"I went to sleep before I went to bed,",0,English
586,Especially in winter when the bed,0,English
586,Might just as well be ice and the clothes snow.,0,English
586,The night the bones came up the cellar-stairs,0,English
586,"Toffile had gone to bed alone and left me,",0,English
586,But left an open door to cool the room off,0,English
586,So as to sort of turn me out of it.,0,English
586,I was just coming to myself enough,0,English
586,"To wonder where the cold was coming from,",0,English
586,When I heard Toffile upstairs in the bedroom,0,English
586,And thought I heard him downstairs in the cellar.,0,English
586,The board we had laid down to walk dry-shod on,0,English
586,When there was water in the cellar in spring,0,English
586,Struck the hard cellar bottom. And then someone,0,English
586,"Began the stairs, two footsteps for each step,",0,English
586,"The way a man with one leg and a crutch,",0,English
586,"Or a little child, comes up. It wasn't Toffile:",0,English
586,It wasn't anyone who could be there.,0,English
586,The bulkhead double-doors were double-locked,0,English
586,And swollen tight and buried under snow.,0,English
586,The cellar windows were banked up with sawdust,0,English
586,And swollen tight and buried under snow.,0,English
586,It was the bones. I knew them -- and good reason.,0,English
586,My first impulse was to get to the knob,0,English
586,And hold the door. But the bones didn't try,0,English
586,"The door; they halted helpless on the landing,",0,English
586,Waiting for things to happen in their favour.',0,English
586,The faintest restless rustling ran all through them.,0,English
586,I never could have done the thing I did,0,English
586,If the wish hadn't been too strong in me,0,English
586,To see how they were mounted for this walk.,0,English
586,I had a vision of them put together,0,English
586,"Not like a man, but like a chandelier.",0,English
586,So suddenly I flung the door wide on him.,0,English
586,"A moment he stood balancing with emotion,",0,English
586,And all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire,0,English
586,Flashed out and licked along his upper teeth.,0,English
586,Smoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.),0,English
586,"Then he came at me with one hand outstretched,",0,English
586,The way he did in life once; but this time,0,English
586,"I struck the hand off brittle on the floor,",0,English
586,And fell back from him on the floor myself.,0,English
586,The finger-pieces slid in all directions.,0,English
586,(Where did I see one of those pieces lately?,0,English
586,Hand me my button-box- it must be there.),0,English
586,"I sat up on the floor and shouted, 'Toffile,",0,English
586,It's coming up to you.' It had its choice,0,English
586,Of the door to the cellar or the hall.,0,English
586,"It took the hall door for the novelty,",0,English
586,"And set off briskly for so slow a thing,",0,English
586,"Stillgoing every which way in the joints, though,",0,English
586,"So that it looked like lightning or a scribble,",0,English
586,From the slap I had just now given its hand.,0,English
586,I listened till it almost climbed the stairs,0,English
586,"From the hall to the only finished bedroom,",0,English
586,Before I got up to do anything;,0,English
586,"Then ran and shouted, 'Shut the bedroom door,",0,English
586,"Toffile, for my sake!' 'Company?' he said,",0,English
586,'Don't make me get up; I'm too warm in bed.',0,English
586,So lying forward weakly on the handrail,0,English
586,"I pushed myself upstairs, and in the light",0,English
586,(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own,0,English
586,"I could see nothing. 'Toffile, I don't see it.",0,English
586,It's with us in the room though. It's the bones.',0,English
586,'What bones?' 'The cellar bones- out of the grave.',0,English
586,That made him throw his bare legs out of bed,0,English
586,And sit up by me and take hold of me.,0,English
586,I wanted to put out the light and see,0,English
586,"If I could see it, or else mow the room,",0,English
586,"With our arms at the level of our knees,",0,English
586,And bring the chalk-pile down. 'I'll tell you what-,0,English
586,It's looking for another door to try.,0,English
586,The uncommonly deep snow has made him think,0,English
586,"Of his old song, The Wild Colonial Boy,",0,English
586,He always used to sing along the tote-road.,0,English
586,He's after an open door to get out-doors.,0,English
586,Let's trap him with an open door up attic.',0,English
586,"Toffile agreed to that, and sure enough,",0,English
586,"Almost the moment he was given an opening,",0,English
586,The steps began to climb the attic stairs.,0,English
586,I heard them. Toffile didn't seem to hear them.,0,English
586,'Quick !' I slammed to the door and held the knob.,0,English
586,"'Toffile, get nails.' I made him nail the door shut,",0,English
586,And push the headboard of the bed against it.,0,English
586,Then we asked was there anything,0,English
586,Up attic that we'd ever want again.,0,English
586,The attic was less to us than the cellar.,0,English
586,"If the bones liked the attic, let them have it.",0,English
586,Let them stay in the attic. When they sometimes,0,English
586,Come down the stairs at night and stand perplexed,0,English
586,"Behind the door and headboard of the bed,",0,English
586,"Brushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,",0,English
586,"With sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,",0,English
586,That's what I sit up in the dark to say -,0,English
586,To no one any more since Toffile died.,0,English
586,2o3 Let them stay in the attic since they went there.,0,English
586,I promised Toffile to be cruel to them,0,English
586,For helping them be cruel once to him.,0,English
586,SON: We think they had a grave down in the cellar.,0,English
586,MOTHER: We know they had a grave down in the cellar.,0,English
586,SON: We never could find out whose bones they were.,0,English
586,"MOTHER: Yes, we could too, son. Tell the truth for once.",0,English
586,They were a man's his father killed for me.,0,English
586,I mean a man he killed instead of me.,0,English
586,The least I could do was to help dig their grave.,0,English
586,We were about it one night in the cellar.,0,English
586,Son knows the story: but 'twas not for him,0,English
586,"To tell the truth, suppose the time had come.",0,English
586,Son looks surprised to see me end a lie,0,English
586,We'd kept all these years between ourselves,0,English
586,So as to have it ready for outsiders.,0,English
586,But to-night I don't care enough to lie -,0,English
586,I don't remember why I ever cared.,0,English
586,"Toffile, if he were here, I don't believe",0,English
586,Could tell you why he ever cared himself -,0,English
586,She hadn't found the finger-bone she wanted,0,English
586,Among the buttons poured out in her lap.,0,English
586,I verified the name next morning: Toffile.,0,English
586,The rural letter-box said Toffile Lajway.,0,English
587,"Come with rain, O loud Southwester!",0,English
587,"Bring the singer, bring the nester;",0,English
587,Give the buried flower a dream;,0,English
587,Make the settled snow-bank steam;,0,English

587,Melt it as the ice will go;,0,English
587,Melt the glass and leave the sticks,0,English
587,Like a hermit's crucifix;,0,English
587,Burst into my narrow stall;,0,English
587,Swing the picture on the wall;,0,English

587,Turn the poet out of door.,0,English

588,"After the ground is frozen, I should have done",0,English

588,So Brad McLaughlin mingled reckless talk,0,English
588,"Of heavenly stars with hugger-mugger farming,",0,English
588,Till having failed at hugger-mugger farming,0,English
588,He burned his house down for the fire insurance,0,English
588,And spent the proceeds on a telescope,0,English
588,To satisfy a lifelong curiosity,0,English
588,About our place among the infinities.,0,English
588,`What do you want with one of those blame things?',0,English
588,I asked him well beforehand. `Don't you get one!',0,English
588,`Don't call it blamed; there isn't anything,0,English
588,More blameless in the sense of being less,0,English
588,"A weapon in our human fight,' he said.",0,English
588,`I'll have one if I sell my farm to buy it.',0,English
588,There where he moved the rocks to plow the ground,0,English

588,Few farms changed hands; so rather than spend years,0,English
588,"Trying to sell his farm and then not selling,",0,English
588,He burned his house down for the fire insurance,0,English
588,And bought the telescope with what it came to.,0,English
588,He had been heard to say by several:,0,English
588,`The best thing that we're put here for's to see;,0,English
588,The strongest thing that's given us to see with's,0,English
588,A telescope. Someone in every town,0,English
588,Seems to me owes it to the town to keep one.,0,English
588,In Littleton it might as well be me.',0,English
588,After such loose talk it was no surprise,0,English
588,When he did what he did and burned his house down.,0,English
588,Mean laughter went about the town that day,0,English
588,"To let him know we weren't the least imposed on,",0,English
588,And he could wait---we'd see to him tomorrow.,0,English
588,But the first thing next morning we reflected,0,English
588,If one by one we counted people out,0,English
588,"For the least sin, it wouldn't take us long",0,English
588,To get so we had no one left to live with.,0,English
588,For to be social is to be forgiving.,0,English
588,"Our thief, the one who does our stealing from us,",0,English
588,"We don't cut off from coming to church suppers,",0,English
588,But what we miss we go to him and ask for.,0,English
588,"He promptly gives it back, that is if still",0,English
588,"Uneaten, unworn out, or undisposed of.",0,English
588,It wouldn't do to be too hard on Brad,0,English
588,About his telescope. Beyond the age,0,English
588,"Of being given one for Christmas gift,",0,English
588,He had to take the best way he knew how,0,English
588,"To find himself in one. Well, all we said was",0,English
588,He took a strange thing to be roguish over.,0,English
588,"Some sympathy was wasted on the house,",0,English
588,A good old-timer dating back along;,0,English
588,But a house isn't sentient; the house,0,English
588,"Didn't feel anything. And if it did,",0,English
588,"Why not regard it as a sacrifice,",0,English
588,"And an old-fashioned sacrifice by fire,",0,English
588,Instead of a new-fashioned one at auction?,0,English
588,Out of a house and so out of a farm,0,English
588,"At one stroke (of a match), Brad had to turn",0,English
588,"To earn a living on the Concord railroad,",0,English
588,As under-ticket-agent at a station,0,English
588,"Where his job, when he wasn't selling tickets,",0,English
588,"Was setting out, up track and down, not plants",0,English
588,"As on a farm, but planets, evening stars",0,English
588,That varied in their hue from red to green.,0,English
588,He got a good glass for six hundred dollars.,0,English
588,His new job gave him leisure for stargazing.,0,English
588,Often he bid me come and have a look,0,English
588,"Up the brass barrel, velvet black inside,",0,English
588,At a star quaking in the other end.,0,English
588,I recollect a night of broken clouds,0,English
588,"And underfoot snow melted down to ice,",0,English
588,And melting further in the wind to mud.,0,English
588,Bradford and I had out the telescope.,0,English
588,"We spread our two legs as we spread its three,",0,English
588,"Pointed our thoughts the way we pointed it,",0,English
588,"And standing at our leisure till the day broke,",0,English
588,Said some of the best things we ever said.,0,English
588,"That telescope was christened the Star-Splitter,",0,English
588,Because it didn't do a thing but split,0,English
588,"A star in two or three, the way you split",0,English
588,A globule of quicksilver in your hand,0,English
588,With one stroke of your finger in the middle.,0,English

588,"Do we know any better where we are,",0,English

588,And a man with a smoky lantern chimney?,0,English
588,How different from the way it ever stood?,0,English
