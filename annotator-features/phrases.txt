buy me a wife
sat by the fire
women with men
maybe i love her
wives waiting
stay awake
dual gendered
sometimes 
little boys made of
smoke all night
not satisfied
took her
no bigger than
nan
she's dead
kissed them
swing in my waist
she'll die
cups of your
upon you
fall asleep
mummy on the bus
kisses
mothers got none
pulled her out
fetch me
built for sin
seven wives
thighs caressed
sustain'd kiss
umbilical cords
touching you
magic of puberty
have been abed
wash dishes
pleasure of men with women
he be married
a-milking
chose a maid
getting a man
takes a wife
be mine
set them to work
sew a fine seam
`mong the sheep
lovely bottom
time of the month
little girls made of
cry himself to sleep
 ’twadn’t a woman
man up
bring my wife home in a wheelbarrow
for the girls
her nape
fathers got money
men don't cry
never constant
concieve daughters
in the kitchen
good nature
object of desire
seven sacks
take me one
smiling woman
considered a sin
night of love
will be
come under my bush
shover her
white thighs
kings men
carried a broom
la bella dame sans merci
put her in
will be the fiddler's wife
female soothing a child
I take your offer kind
have a new master
man of the house
act like
king's men
only of me
house clean
keep her
us was wed
sleeps up
nothing at all
ride of my breasts
thrusting me beneath 
have no
kissed the maiden
caught her
ran after
seek a wife
leave her mother
watch all night
Whimpered 
didn’t love her
takes the child
didn’t know what to do
your man
crushed me
wedding band
come home with me
sexual drive
shall have
do not have her
my body
gives up
be my queen
body of my
stars
